 * does not carry, so one is resolved from TMDB's `external_ids` first.

 * The channel's own `tvg-id` is tried too, because that is the id a playlist and a
 * live add-on both know, and `tv` is tried last for add-ons that treat a channel as a
 * one-off title. Nothing is invented: an add-on with no live streams answers with
