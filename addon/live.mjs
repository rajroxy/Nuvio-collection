/**
 * Live TV & Sports — the premium/DTH lineups, and the guide.
 *
 * Sources, in the order the request asked for them:
 *
 *   dth      the **premium, DTH and operator catalogue** (`dth.mjs`): the providers
 *            you subscribe to, read as a lineup and a guide. This is the default,
 *            and it is what the profile is for.
 *   m3u      your own playlist (an M3U/M3U8 URL or a local file) — what your own
 *            box or operator app exports
 *   xtream   an Xtream Codes login (host + username + password)
 *
 * It used to default to a **public free-TV directory** (iptv-org's own category
 * playlists). That is gone: a premium-television profile opening on free public
 * streams is the wrong app, and the directory's channels are not the ones anyone
 * subscribes to. What replaced it is not another public list — it is a catalogue of
 * real DTH/cable/premium operators, per country, read for its **lineup and guide**.
 *
 * Streams are never invented and never shipped: a premium channel's stream is
 * delivered to a subscriber's box. Export it from your own box as an M3U (or log in
 * to your Xtream panel) and the two meet on `tvg-id`: the guide is keyed on it, so
 * your playlist's channel lands exactly on the catalogue's lineup.
 *
 * The guide is XMLTV (`live.epg`, or a picked provider's own public feed). With one
 * set the Guide draws real programmes; without one it still draws the lineup and
 * says so, rather than inventing a schedule.
 *
 * Everything is cached on disk (git-ignored) and re-read on the app's refresh clock.
