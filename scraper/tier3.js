/**
 * Tier 3 — a real browser, when nothing else can read the page.
 *
 * The tiers below this one are honest attempts at being cheap: a fetch, then a DOM
 * sandbox. Both fail on the same class of page — one that only works in a real engine
 * (canvas, WebGL, a bot check) — and that is what this tier is: Chromium, driven over
 * CDP, waiting for the page to finish talking to the network, handing back the HTML a
 * visitor would have got.
 *
 * Two things make it usable rather than theoretical:
 *
 * 1. **The stealth plugin.** A default headless Chromium announces itself (navigator
 *    flags, missing plugins, a driver in the connection) and a site that checks for it
 *    serves a challenge instead of a video. The plugin removes those tells, so the page
 *    renders. Use this only on sites you are allowed to read: a site that asks not to be
 *    automated is telling you something, and it is your call whether you may anyway.
 * 2. **One browser, borrowed.** Launching Chromium costs a second and a few hundred
 *    megabytes; a page that needed tier 3 usually needs it again a moment later. The
 *    process is kept alive between calls and shut down after a minute of quiet.
 *
 * This tier is optional. If Playwright or its browser is not installed, the function
 * answers `null` with a reason, and the app keeps working exactly as it did.
