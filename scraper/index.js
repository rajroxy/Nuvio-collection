/**
 * The stream extractor's front door.
 *
 * A page the add-ons do not cover can still hold a playable video — a direct file, a
 * playlist, or a `<video>` element a site draws for itself. `extractStreams` is the one
 * entry point the rest of the app calls; how it finds them is the tiers' business, not
 * the caller's:
 *
 *   tier 1  a plain fetch + a regex over the markup   (scraper/tier1.js + finder.js)
 *   tier 2  the page's own scripts run in a DOM sandbox (scraper/tier2.js)
 *   tier 3  a real browser, for the pages neither of those can read (scraper/tier3.js)
 *   plugin  a rule written by hand for one site (scraper/plugins.js), tried last
 *
 * Every answer carries the metadata a stream list needs (`scraper/meta.js`) as well as the
 * URL: quality, format, protocol, domain and a human title — never a UUID, never a bare
 * hash. The **page URL is kept on the row too**, because a page that served this stream
 * usually wants its own `Referer` when something later fetches the file itself.
 *
 * `source` is the tier that produced the row, so the UI can say which one answered.
