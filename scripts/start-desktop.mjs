// Launches the Electron desktop app. This is what `npm start` runs, from the
// repo root (`node scripts/start-desktop.mjs`) or from `desktop/`
// (`node ../scripts/start-desktop.mjs`).
//
// Electron is a package plus a ~100MB binary that its postinstall fetches, so
// there are two ways a fresh clone ends up without it:
//   1. the desktop dependencies were never installed at all, or
//   2. npm >= 11.16/12 blocked the postinstall because `electron` is not in the
//      package's `allowScripts` list (npm warns "1 package had install scripts
//      blocked"), which leaves the package present but the binary missing.
// Either way `electron .` dies with "Electron failed to install correctly".
// This wrapper fixes both: it installs the dependencies, and if the binary is
// still missing it runs Electron's own installer (`node install.js`) directly,
// which is exactly what the blocked postinstall would have done. So `npm start`
// always ends in the app, never in an error or a server url.
