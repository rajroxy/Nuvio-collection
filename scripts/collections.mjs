 *   key       stable id — also the cover filename and the catalog id suffix
 *   lines     the title, split across lines for the cover
 *   catalogs  the catalogs inside this card, per row: { movie: [...], show: [...] }
 *
 * **Nothing here is guessed.** Genre names, provider ids and keyword ids all
 * come from `tmdb-verified.json`, produced by `scripts/probe-tmdb.mjs` against
 * the live TMDB API and checked to actually return titles. Guessing any of them
 * is what used to produce rows with no titles in them (TMDB renamed HBO Max to
 * Max, moved Paramount+ in the US, and its keyword search returns "based on
 * visual novel" for "based on novel").
 *
 * Catalog entry kinds and their params:
 *
 *   preset        value: trending | popular | top_rated | now_playing |
 *                 airing_today | airing_this_week | on_the_air
 *   discover      value: latest | new
 *   genre         genre, sort?: "popular"
 *   decade        decade (e.g. 1950), sort?: "popular"
 *   genre-decade  genre, from
 *   continent     codes: ["JP", …]
 *   country       code: "IN"
 *   runtime       min: 30
 *   episodes      max: 4
 *   keyword       id   (verified TMDB keyword id)
 *   provider      providerId, region   (an OTT service in that region)
 *   watchlist     state: planned | watching | watched   (served from the pins)
 *
 *   `take` caps how many titles a catalog keeps. It is only used where the name
 *   promises a fixed size (a ◆ Top 10 really is ten titles) — anywhere else it

/**
 * **A country is published when it has anything at all. There is no size rule.**
 *
 * There used to be a floor here, and it was wrong twice over. First it was compared
 * against a table that held **one page's worth** of each country (20 at most), so eleven
 * films and seven thousand looked identical and the number meant nothing. Then, measured
 * properly, a floor of ten turned TMDB's own coverage of a country into a verdict on that
 * country: Pakistan (38 films, 14 shows), Bangladesh (132/11), Sri Lanka (30/3),
 * Uzbekistan (7), Tonga (1 show) and dozens more were unpublished — no row, no chip, no
 * way in — because TMDB returns fewer titles for them than it does for the United
 * States. That is not a quality judgment this file gets to make, and "there is less of
 * it" is not "there is none of it".
 *
 * So the rule was the smallest true one: **if TMDB has any title for a country on a
 * row type, that country gets that row** — until the user asked for the opposite:
 * countries with **fewer than fifty titles** on a row type are out, `MIN_COUNTRY_TITLES
 * = 50`, still asked **per type**. This cuts real catalogs, and that is the point of
 * writing it down: Pakistan's 38-film row goes, Qatar (41 films / 2 shows) goes
 * entirely, Sri Lanka (30/3), Nepal (20 films), Azerbaijan (16), Bermuda (11),
 * Uzbekistan (7), Indonesia's 21-show row (its 592 films stay), Bangladesh's 11-show
 * row (its 132 films stay), Thailand keeps 629/433 and Egypt 724/117. The 29 named
 * removals (`REMOVED_COUNTRY_NAMES`) still apply on top, and the 36 territories TMDB
 * returns nothing for were never published.
 *
 * `countryHasContent` is what everything reads — the Countries card's rows, the search
 * panel's country chips, the cross-country shuffle pool and the continent rows — so no
 * screen can offer a country another screen does not.

 *    return nothing at all, so they were never published.)

 *    French Polynesia, Gibraltar, Greenland, Guam, Martinique and Réunion: places
 *    administered from elsewhere rather than countries of their own.
 * 4. **States that no longer exist** — the Soviet Union (2,350 films), Yugoslavia
